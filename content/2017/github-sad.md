![Dark Github][]


Yesterday I came across this [Github][] changes, and it immediately struck a chord with me. If you haven’t seen it already, I’ll sum it up for you here.

Github navigation bar is now black, only when signed in. Previously, navigation bar was the same (white) regardless of whether signed out or in.

It’s been available already to enterprise users for some time. Apparently, it's now here to stay, and I think it's going to take some getting used to. Previous navigation bar (white) makes sense for a couple reasons:

- The logo feels natural when the cat is dark and the surrounding is light. It has appeared this way on Github's products.

- The inconsistency between being signed in vs signed out and their blog still showing the white navigation bar had me confused.

- The multi-tier navigation system becomes more distinguishable when the top navigation is black and the secondary navigations underneath are white, since it draws the eyes to the navigation instead of the content.

I feel sad, but i'm looking forward to hearing any official word from Github about the change. I noticed that it ended up getting a lot of attention on [Reddit][]. (The Reddit discussion can be found here: [GitHub just changed the upper navbar to black][].)
