Some quick thoughts about how life is just too short, and doing what you love:

It's about **11pm** right now and instead of sleeping, I'm thinking about life, about all the things I want to accomplish, and what I need to do to get there. Maybe it's because my *birthday* is almost here (in about an hour), or because I've been having weird "grown up" life experiences.

This past year has been the best. I have more skills, connections, victories, struggles, achievements -- more *everything*. I've learned more about the real world, about what I'm good at and awful at, and predominantly about what makes me happy.

Having said that, I've made mistakes. I've:

- Been afraid to take risks.
- Hidden my true intentions and thoughts from friends and strangers.
- Not done things because of what people might think, or because they seemed **too crazy**.
- Not stood up for what I believe in.
- Picked up nasty habits and done unpleasant things.
- Tried to make everyone happy, instead of myself.

While I'm currently really happy with my day-to-day life -- I enjoy the things
I'm working on each day, constantly learning new skills, building habits into my daily routine, and pushing myself beyond my comfort barrier -- I'm always craving *more*.

Inside of me, there's always a wrangle over:

> "Go with the flow and be content with yourself! You're happy with what you're currently doing."

> And: "Don't settle for your current situation or less, constantly focus on doing bigger, better things. Be happy with yourself, but push yourself outside your limits!"

Does anyone else feel this way? Is this normal?


## Enjoy Life

Since work is such a large part of our life, slaving away on things you hate is
probably a rapid way to become uptight, build stress, and lower your morale.

> "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you; know when you find it." - **Steve Jobs**

If you're working on something you can't stand, it probably isn't worth it to stick around and keep working. There's just not enough time in life to do things you hate, so instead of wasting your time away, just do the things you love.

> "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma -- which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice." - **Steve Jobs**

Forget about other peoples' thoughts and do what you think is right. Things always seems crazy at first (until you do them), so don't let your fear make your decisions for you. Take risks, have fun, and enjoy life.

> "Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." - **Steve Jobs**

So, I'm going to start keeping it real. If you wanna hang out, [shoot me an email][]!
