![Chibi Gaara Crying Sketch][]


I joined [Twitter][] March 2012 and was an avid user with about 23k tweets, 700+ followers and I constantly share my thoughts, connect with experts in different profession, get news, technology or service update and many more.

Recently, I found out about [Tweet Preservation][], and how Twitter in April, 2010 signed an agreement to donate access to the entire archive of public Tweets from 2006 (i.e. Twitter's inception) through April 2010. Additionally, they'll provide [Library of Congress] an ongoing basis to tweets for preservation and research, which the Library could make any portion of the archive available six months after it was originally posted on Twitter to researchers.

On December 2017, the Library changed it's tweets collection strategy to acquire selective tweets under the overall guidance provided in the Library’s Collections Policy Statements and associated documents ([loc.gov/acq/devpol/][]). After further reading, I became unhappy especially reading some unanswered comments on Library of Congress blog posts questioning Tweet Preservation:

## Thoughts

Twitter processes more than 50 million tweets every day, with the total numbering in the billions, I honestly feel every Twitter user should be occasionally notified when using Twitter about Tweet Preservation and/or allow users opt-out.

Since I got on Twitter, I’ve met tons of experts in my field (Programming). I’ve had some expert mentor me, learned, written and spoken about all sorts of things. I even ended up helping some followers level up on core Programming concepts. Although I’ve learned a ton and had a LOT of fun using Twitter, I’ve been slowly getting tired of 140 characters and now reading about Tweet Preservation I realize it's time to move on.

With that said, I’ve officially deactivated my Twitter account, and will now only be using products like [Hacker News][], [Reddit][] and [Stackoverflow][]. Also, I've referenced below links to blogs, agreement and PDFs addressing Tweet Preservation.
