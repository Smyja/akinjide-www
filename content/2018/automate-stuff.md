Ok, automate stuff? Why automate? If you've ever spent hours:

- updating, moving or renaming files and folders,
- searching the web and downloading content,
- merging, splitting, encrypting or adding watermark to PDFs,
- resizing images
- or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you'd know this tasks are tedious.

But what if you could have your computer do them for you? What if you can write a program to do in minutes what would take you hours to do? As a programmer, ask yourself this questions, simply put, will I save more (time, resources) if I automate this stuff?

Automation is going to take some effort, effort = time. Why spend the time? We need to get time back, of course. For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a very specific idea of perfection and absolutely consumed by the idea of fully automating programs.

Perfection in my mind is complete automation, I imagine a world where we solve every small (or large) problem with software or hardware solution; engineering each of these small, independent solutions without requiring any human intervention while running and managing itself indefinitely.

Regardless of how fully automated a problem is, we all know computers doing everything for us will cause them to one day take over the earth. But some people out there have neither watched [the Matrix][] nor [Terminator][] movies and are working diligently toward making computers do people jobs.

However, what if you never had to do those tedious tasks again because there was a sustainable, lasting solution to those issues? What if you never had to implement a user profile on a website because there was some service which permanently solved the problem?


## You only live once

I don’t like making a big deal out of things so small and insignificant. I consider myself a reasonably logical and smart guy -- but sometimes I just think “WHOA. I really need to just let go and automate this stuff I repeat. Life is way too short for that.”

Nonetheless, don't spend your time doing work a well-trained monkey (or computer) could do. Even if you've never written a [line of code][], learn and make your computer do the grunt work. Remember your overall goal is perfect automation, and now start automating.
